## Overview

### The challenge

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes

Yet todo:

- Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- Build this project as a full-stack application
